# .vimrc
My .vimrc file on VB. I'm putting it here for convenience. I started using vim earlier this semester. I imagine I'll have more things on this list as I use it more frequently.

Currently, these are the changes that I have:
  - TAB = 4 spaces
  - smart-TAB on
  - typing 'jk' exits whatever mode I'm in
